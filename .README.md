# Nanoblog

This project is my personal blog. Built with no framework, engine handmade with [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) for templates and [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) for markdown parsing.

## Motivation

- Why not use Jekyll, or some other engine?
These engines have a lot of features I don't need. They also have some features I "need" (such as styling), however it felt easy enough to just build it like this.

## To-do

- Add a `last edited at yyyy-mm-dd` field at the top of posts
