# Nanoblog

This project is my personal blog. Built with [basic-ssg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-ssg).

## Motivation

- Why not use Jekyll, or some other engine?

These engines have a lot of features I don't need. Going from scratch felt easier and much more customizable, specially with a custom theming.
